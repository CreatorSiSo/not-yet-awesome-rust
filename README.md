# Not-Yet-Awesome Rust

A curated list of Rust code and resources that do **NOT** exist yet, but would be beneficial to the Rust community.

The purpose of this list is twofold:

* Enumerate **specific use cases and their problems domains** that do not yet have a robust ecosystem in Rust.
    * The definition of "specific" and "robust" for this list is yet to be determined!
* Encourage the Rust community to approach gaps in the Rust ecosystem by providing this list as a point of collaboration!

Questions, concerns, something else you want to say? Contact me (@erichdongubler)! :)

### I don't see something I care about/think is {useful,important}!

If you're viewing this on the Github website, click the little pencil icon to the top right and use the Markdown editor to send us a PR ASAP!

If you're not using Github...send us a PR anyway. We want to know!

### Hey, there's something on this list, but Rust HAS something for it!

Open an issue so we can cross 'er out and make sure people know!
* Feel free to open an issue when you have a library that *satisfies the use cases* that are listed here -- knocking them off can only be a good thing.
    * You may also want to submit your work to [awesome-rust](https://github.com/rust-unofficial/awesome-rust), if you think it's good enough!
* For now, items will NOT be deleted from this list -- merely crossed out ~~like this~~, so people can come back and see if progress has been made on what they care about.

## The List

### Data forensics
* Ability to parse `Registry.pol` files from Windows machines
    * @erichdongubler is actually working on this -- but it's not on a public repo yet. :)
